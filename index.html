<h2>My first html page in a very long time. Or is it?</h2>
<h3>Added yet another heading. A bit smaller this time.</h3>
    <p>This is my first paragraph!
        <br>
        It's got some text in it.

        Let's twist things a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>So I figured I would add another paragraph, to see what the text's XPath looks like when there are no "br" tags.
        <br>OK, added a "br" tag here, but I learned how a simple change in the HTML structure can affect the XPath...

    <p>
        Would it mean that unique Id attributes of elements would make automation scripts more reliable?
        <br>Uniqe and unchanging for each element...

    <p title="For some reason I really like it.">
        This paragraph contains a toolip when you put mouse cursor over it!

    <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("remove_it").innerHTML = "Much better."'>This page is hideous!</button>
