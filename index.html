<H2>My first html page in a very long time. Or is it?</H2>
<H3>Added yet another heading. A bit smaller this time.</H3>
    <P>This is my first paragraph!
        <BR>
        It's got some text in it.
        <img src="image.jpg">
    </P>
    <P>
        Let's twist things a bit more.
    </P>
    <P>So I figured I would add another paragraph, to see what the text's XPath looks like when there are no "BR" tags.
        <BR>OK, added a "BR" tag here, but I learned how a simple change in the HTML structure can affect the XPath...
    </P>
    <P>
        Would it mean that unique Id attributes of elements would make automation scripts more reliable?
        <BR>Uniqe and unchanging for each element...
    </P>
    <P title="For some reason I really like it.">
        This paragraph contains a toolip when you put mouse cursor over it!
