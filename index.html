<HEAD></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>My first html page in a very long time. Or is it?</H2>
<H3>Added yet another heading. A bit smaller this time.</H3>
    <P>This is my first paragraph!
        <BR>
        It's got some text in it.
    </P>
    <P>So I figured I would add another paragraph, to see what the text's XPath looks like when there are no "BR" tags
