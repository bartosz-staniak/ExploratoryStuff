<h2>My first html page in a very long time. Or is it?</h2>
<h3>Added yet another heading. A bit smaller this time.</h3>
    <p>This is my first paragraph!
        <br>
        It's got some text in it.
        <div>
        <img id="image" src="image.jpg">
        <button id="buttonImage" onclick="hideShowImg()">Hide this image</button>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's twist things a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>So I figured I would add another paragraph, to see what the text's XPath looks like when there are no "br" tags.
        <br>OK, added a "br" tag here, but I learned how a simple change in the HTML structure can affect the XPath...
    </p>
    <p>
        Would it mean that unique Id attributes of elements would make automation scripts more reliable?
        <br>Uniqe and unchanging for each element...
    </p>
    <p title="For some reason I really like it.">
        This paragraph contains a toolip when you put mouse cursor over it!
